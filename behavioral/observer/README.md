The Observer Pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

We have one _subject_, who notifies _many observers_ when something in the subject changes. The observers are _dependent_ on the subject.

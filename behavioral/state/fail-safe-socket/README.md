Demonstrates using the State pattern to create a client socke that doesn't break when losing connection with the server.

To install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the example, you will need two terminal windows.

In the first, run:

```bash
node server.js
```

In the second window, run:

```bash
node client.js
```

Try starting the client before the server to see the state change.
